## Description

Here I took a pre designed SEO landing page that doesn't have semantic html and ungrouped CSS items that can be grouped to make cleaner code that is easier to follow for other developers.

I built this project so that I could create cleaner and more efficient code in the future.

It solves problems that could waste time of other developers coming to edit the code as well as causing myself to be confused coming back to it.

Through the process I learnt about the importance of semantic Html, the use of alt text on images for people using screen readers and how to recognise when to make CSS classes.
